# Aciduric
A colourful, shifty theme for Visual Studio Code.

> **Aciduric:** tolerating a highly acid environment

Inspired by [Gogh's "Aci" theme](https://github.com/Gogh-Co/Gogh/blob/master/themes/Aci.yml).

Install from either the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://127.0.0.1), or the [Releases page](https://github.com/leif-motif/aciduric-vscode/releases).
